# tic-tac-toe-with-minimax-in-js
Tic Tac Toe game with minimax algorithm written in JS and JQuery

Couple of notes on functionality:
- You can choose the board size, it will still calculate winner properly
- It uses minimax algorithm written in javascript and JQuery to determine best course of action
- As it relies on recursive calls, it will fail to calculate for boards bigger than 3 due to stack overflow
